# GWBasic-Jukebox
for old times sake, a few tunes in GWBasic along with some drawing and painting of a jukebox

My own knowledge of computer programming started with GWBasic when I was a child, in the '90s.
It wasn't as user friendly as more modern programming languages, it was very mechanical
when it came to drawing lines and circles and painting areas of the screen.
It's very tedious to manually type the line numbers, possibly having to re-number the lines
individually every time a simple change is made.

Back then there was no git or github, so I lost a lot of the projects I tinkered with.
But seeing my nephew started getting interested in computer programming recently,
and started getting an introduction to GWBasic, he put me to the test in working out
some GWBasic programming within DOSBox.

So this is just a demonstrative script that draws a jukebox using boxes and arcs and lines,
calculating the intersections of the lines with the arcs, and painting within the areas
of these boxes, while allowing user input to play a tune. I'm not a wizard
when it comes to mathematical formulas, but at least I am able to work out coordinates
in a cartesian system, and at least I succeeded in drawing the boxes and arcs and calculating the
intersection of the lines with the arcs.
